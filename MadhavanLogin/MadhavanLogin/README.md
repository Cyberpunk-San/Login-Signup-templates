## How to Use / Integration

1. Copy the entire `MadhavanLogin` folder into your project directory. This will include all necessary HTML, CSS, JS, and image files required for the template to work properly.

   - The CSS file controls the layout, styling, and responsive design of the login and registration forms.
   - The JavaScript file handles form switching between login and registration screens as well as interactive elements.

3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view and test the template. Ensure that all styles and interactions are working as expected.

4. Customize the template according to your project requirements:
   - Update form action URLs or backend integration for login and registration functionality.
   - Modify input fields, buttons, or text to match your design and user experience.
   - Adjust colors, fonts, and layout in the CSS file if needed for your project‚Äôs branding.

5. Verify responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes to ensure the template works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
