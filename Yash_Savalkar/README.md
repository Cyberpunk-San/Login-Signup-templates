🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 – Structure of the web page

CSS3 – Styling and transitions

Vanilla JavaScript – Toggle and animation logic

Font Awesome – Social media icons

🎨 Animation Logic

The animation is achieved by toggling the class:

container.classList.add("right-panel-active");


and

container.classList.remove("right-panel-active");


When this class is applied, CSS transitions move the overlay panel smoothly to reveal the alternate form.
